E-commerce | Full-time | Remote-friendly

🚀 About the Project
We’re building a modern, high-traffic e-commerce platform where performance, scalability, and conversion-focused UX are non-negotiable.

Our frontend stack is React (18+) + TypeScript, powered by Node.js APIs, and supports complex, real-world flows — from large product catalogs and pricing logic to carts, checkout, and user accounts across web and mobile.

Our mission: deliver a fast, reliable shopping experience at scale, backed by clean architecture and a high engineering bar.


🛠 What You’ll Do
Build and ship core e-commerce experiences using React + TypeScript:
product listings, PDPs, cart, checkout, and account flows.

Design and maintain scalable frontend architecture using modern patterns
(feature-based modules, reusable components, custom hooks).

Integrate with Node.js REST APIs for products, pricing, inventory, promotions, orders, and users.

Manage client and server state using Redux Toolkit, React Query, or similar tools.

Implement responsive, accessible, mobile-first UIs using Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or Styled Components.

Optimize frontend performance: bundle size, code-splitting, lazy loading, memoization, Core Web Vitals.

Collaborate closely with backend, product, and design to deliver features end-to-end.

Participate in code reviews and help improve engineering standards and documentation.

👀 You Might Be a Fit If You Have
Strong production experience with React and TypeScript.

Solid understanding of modern JavaScript (ES2020+), async patterns, and browser fundamentals.

Experience integrating frontend applications with Node.js backends via REST APIs.

Hands-on experience with state management (Redux Toolkit, React Query, Zustand, or similar).

Experience building data-heavy UIs (filters, pagination, search, sorting).

Practical knowledge of frontend performance optimization and debugging.

Familiarity with authentication flows (JWT, sessions, OAuth).

Comfort working in a collaborative, Git-based workflow.


📈 Level & Experience
We hire for impact and capability, not just years.

Mid-level: typically 3–5 years building React applications with growing ownership.

Senior: typically 5+ years, with clear architectural influence and mentoring experience.

If you demonstrate senior-level impact without matching the years exactly — we still want to talk.

⚠️ Note: This role is not suitable for junior developers.


✨ Nice to Have
E-commerce experience (checkout flows, payments, pricing, promotions).

Familiarity with Next.js (SSR/SSG) and SEO considerations.

Testing experience with Jest and React Testing Library.

Experience with analytics, monitoring, or experimentation tools
(Datadog, Sentry, GA, PostHog).

Accessibility knowledge (WCAG).

Experience working in Agile / Scrum teams.

✅ Success in This Role Looks Like
You consistently deliver high-quality, reliable e-commerce features, keep the UI fast and maintainable, and help raise the overall frontend engineering bar through thoughtful design, collaboration, and technical ownership.
